## Profile Diagnosis and Evolution

In response to changes in cognitive characteristics at different stages, we diagnose the user’s cognitive level by acquiring long-term interaction records, mining behavioral pattern data, and performing knowledge tracking.

Specifically, through quantitative cognitive-level diagnosis based  on structured dialogues, we complete diversified cognitive diagnostics. By combining cognitive diagnostic models, we comprehensively analyze both the explicit and implicit cognitive traits of learners, accurately depicting their mastery and cognitive differences across different knowledge points. We dynamically track the  learner’s cognitive state and knowledge acquisition level and utilize cognitive-leveled memory mechanisms to continuously update and store cognitive states, thereby forming a historical trajectory of cognitive evolution that provides data support for predicting future learning trends.

To better understand the learner’s cognitive state, we continuously record the learner’s interaction behaviors, learning outcomes, and changes in cognitive status over different time periods. By analyzing the dynamic changes in learning behavior patterns and knowledge acquisition, we uncover the cognitive development patterns and stage characteristics of the learner throughout the long-term learning process. This improves the long-term learning  efficiency of adaptive learning systems and enhances the intelligent intervention capabilities of digital teachers. Furthermore, by analyzing the relationship between cognition and knowledge through cross-stage profile alignment, we map the learner’s cognitive performance on different knowledge points to a knowledge graph. This constructs a dynamic linkage between knowledge and cognition, enabling the visualization of multidimensional learner profiles.

Finally, this section dynamically updates the learner profile, optimizes learning path planning, and recommends personalized teaching content, thereby improving teaching effectiveness.

## Knowledge Reasoning and Updating

To enhance the credibility of intellectual reasoning, an innovative approach is proposed that  combines domain knowledge inference and verification, enhancing  the reliability of inference results through continuous discovery  and updating of domain knowledge.

This approach constructs a high-quality disciplinary knowledge system, providing reliable support for the reasoning and services of digital teacher agents.  By integrating large language models, instruction fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation, it performs domain knowledge inference on the disciplinary knowledge system, breaking down complex disciplinary problems into sub-problems to reduce inference complexity and improve accuracy. Existing knowledge graphs or standard knowledge bases are used to verify inference results, identifying potential logical gaps or knowledge inconsistencies.  A self-feedback correction mechanism is also introduced to automatically adjust detected inference deviations while continuously monitoring external data sources and new developments in the field to dynamically add new knowledge or update existing entries.  This dynamic maintenance mechanism enables the knowledge base to evolve continuously, staying responsive to new knowledge, and enhancing the inference reliability and service quality of the digital teacher agent.

## Agent Service Construction

To enhance the effectiveness of large model-based intelligent agents in personalized teaching, this platform integrates a multi-turn dialogue intelligent service framework, combining domain knowledge and learner profiles to support intelligent agents in making precise decisions during the teaching process.

First, through knowledge-integration pre-training techniques and by combining deep learning, transfer learning, and adaptive algorithms, the platform integrates general knowledge and domain specific knowledge into the large model to enhance its teaching reasoning capabilities.   Additionally, we propose a knowledge-data driven personalized decision-making framework, which combines student data and subject knowledge to support accurate personalized recommendations from intelligent agents during the teaching process.  Furthermore, to enhance the interactivity and adaptability of the digital teacher, memory, planning, and reflection modules are employed, enabling the intelligent agent to engage in multi-turn dialogues and continuously optimize teaching strategies.

The platform allows the digital teacher to dynamically adjust teaching content based on student feedback, achieving personalized teaching while improving student engagement and learning efficiency.

## Intelligent Empathetic Interaction 

To address the issue of unnatural human-computer interaction, we employ emotional cognition technology to perform real-time analysis and assessment of learners’ emotions.

First, the digital teacher’s intelligent interaction capabilities are enhanced by optimizing the learning experience from multiple dimensions. Emotional cognition technology enables real-time analysis of the learners’ emotional states during the learning process, helping the digital teacher accurately detect changes in their emotions. By identifying both verbal and non-verbal signals from learners, the system precisely understands their emotional state and provides personalized feedback tailored to their emotional needs.

Additionally, to strengthen guidance and effectiveness in teaching, the guided interactive teaching technique allows the digital teacher to emulate a real teacher’s ability to lead. Specifically, the system can intelligently analyze a learner’s current comprehension level, learning progress, and knowledge acquisition, especially identifying areas of confusion. For these areas, the digital teacher poses progressively guiding questions to help learners gradually understand and master the relevant knowledge points, thereby enhancing their engagement in the learning process and boosting their motivation for self-directed learning.

Moreover, the platform integrates digital human visualization, emotional speech synthesis, and synchronized facial expression  technologies, allowing the virtual teacher’s facial expressions to change in sync with the audio.
